        <h2>Problem.</h2>


        The following problem has been taken from Landau and Lifshitz's Mechanics, 3rd edition, and was given as a problem set question in PHY354. The solution can be extremely shorttened through a simple application 
        of Euler's Angles, however the more interest task is completing the problem without the use of such methods. The question is stated, verbatim, as follows:
        <br><br>
        a) Find the kinetic energy of a homogenous ellipsoid which rotates about one of it's axes while that axis itself rotates about a line $CD$ perpendicular to it and passing through the centre of the ellipsoid.
        <br><br>
        b) The same as part a), but for the case where the axis $AB$  is notm perpendicular to $CD$ and is an axis of symmetry of the ellipsoid.
        <br><br>
        All of the diagrams in this solution have been constructed using AutoCAD.

        <h3>Part a)</h3>
        The ellipsoid orbits around the line AB with angular frequency $\dot{\varphi}$, while the line AB orbits about the line CD with angular frequency $\dot{\theta}$. This is shown in Figure 1. Initially, the principal axes $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are oriented as shown in the left hand side of Figure 1. The right side of Figure 1 shows the orientation of the ellipse at some time later. The rotational kinetic energy of the system is given by;
        \[T_{rot} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i, j}\Omega_iI_{ij}\Omega_j = \frac{1}{2}(\Omega_1^2I_1 + \Omega_2^2I_2 + \Omega_3^3I_3) \tag{1}\]
        when we are in the principal axis basis, where $I_j$ are the principal moments of inertia about $\Omega_j$ are the angular frequency of the system about each principal axis. Note that since the principal axis $x_3$ is oriented along $AB$ initially, it will always lie along this axis of rotation. Hence the component angular frequency $\Omega_3$ is simply given by $\Omega_3 = \dot{\varphi}$. To find the $\Omega_1, \Omega_2$ components, we must project the principal axes $x_1, x_2$ onto the axis of rotation CD, and then multiply by the rotational frequency of the system about that axis (namely, $\dot{\theta}$). This provides,
        \begin{align*}
            \Omega_1 = \dot{\theta}\cos\varphi && \Omega_2 = \dot{\theta}\cos(\pi/2 - \varphi) = \dot{\theta}\sin\varphi
        \end{align*}
        Plugging this into Eq.(1), we obtain
        \[T_{rot} = \frac{\dot{\theta}^2}{2}(I_1\cos^2\varphi + I_2\sin^2\varphi + I_3)\]

        </div>

        <h3>Part b)</h3>
        Similar to part a), the rotational kinetic energy of the system is given by 
        \[T_{rot} = \frac{1}{2}(\Omega_1^2I_1 + \Omega_2^2I_2 + \Omega_3^3I_3)\]
        Since the axis AB is an axis of symmetry, the semi-major axes of the ellipsoid along $x_1$ and $x_2$ must be equal in magnitude, hence implying that $I_1 = I_2$. Thus,
        \[T_{rot} = \frac{I_1}{2}(\Omega_1^2 + \Omega_2^2) + \frac{1}{2}\Omega_3^3I_3 \tag{2}\]
        The system is depicted in Figure 2, where $\alpha$ is the angle at which the ellipsoid is rotated. It is useful to visualize special cases; consider the case where $\dot{\varphi} = 0$. Then to obtain $\Omega_1, \Omega_2$, we simply project the principal axes $x_1, x_2$ onto the axis of rotation CD, and multiply by the angular frequency, $\dot{\theta}$, about that axis. Namely, we would have $\Omega_1 = \dot{\theta}\cos\alpha$ and $\Omega_2 = \dot{\theta}\sin\alpha$, just as in part \textbf{3.9}. Now allowing the system to rotate about about $AB$ ($\dot{\varphi} \neq 0$), we simply project the principal axis onto the axis of rotation CD, and multiply by the angular frequency about that axis. Namely;
        \begin{align*}
            \Omega_1 = \dot{\theta}\cos\alpha\cos\varphi && \Omega_2 = \dot{\theta}\cos\alpha\sin\varphi
        \end{align*}
        This is extremely similar to part a), except we must add additional projection to account for the rotation of magnitude $\alpha$. To compute $\Omega_3$, we once again imagine the case where $\varphi = 0$. Then the principal axis $x_3$ rotates about CD with angular frequency $\dot{\theta}$, while $x_3$ makes an angle $\alpha$ with the line normal to CD. The magnitude of the component of the unit principal axis $x_3$ which is parallel to the axis of rotation $CD$ is then simply $\sin\alpha$. To obtain $\Omega_3$ in this case we simply multiply this value by the angular frequency of the body about the axis of rotation CD: $\Omega_3 = \dot{\theta}\sin\alpha$. Now consider separately the case where $\dot{\theta} = 0$ but $\dot{\varphi} \neq 0$. Then $\Omega_3$ is as given as in \textbf{3.9}; the rotational velocity of the body about the principal axis $x_3$ is simply $\Omega_3 = \dot{\varphi}$. Now allowing both $\dot{\theta}, \dot{\varphi}$ to be non-zero, we simply superpose both of the previous discussions:
        \[\Omega_3 =\dot{\varphi} + \dot{\theta}\sin\alpha\]
        Plugging all of these values into Eq.(2), we obtain
        \[T_{rot} = \frac{I_1\dot{\theta}^2\cos^2\alpha}{2} + \frac{I_3}{2}(\dot{\varphi} + \dot{\theta}\sin\alpha)^2\]
